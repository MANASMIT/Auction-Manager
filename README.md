## 📄 CSV Format

The auction setup is based on a structured CSV file. Key sections include:

* `[CONFIG]` – General auction settings (e.g., auction name).
* `[TEAMS_INITIAL]` – List of teams with their starting money and logo image.
* `[PLAYERS_INITIAL]` – Player list with base bid values and profile photo names.
* `[BID_INCREMENT_RULES]` – *(Optional)* Define bid increments based on price ranges.

💡 Use the built-in documentation or generate a template to ensure correct formatting.
