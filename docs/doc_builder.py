    # It's crucial that the Markdown content itself doesn't contain a literal `</script>` tag
    # that isn't part of a fenced code block. If it does, it will prematurely close
    # our #markdown-source script tag.

    # This is more robust than simple string replacement if the placeholder might have whitespace variations.
    # Regex: (<script type="text/markdown" id="markdown-source"[^>]*>)\s*COMMENT\s*(</script>)

    #   Group 1: The opening script tag (e.g., <script type="text/markdown" id="markdown-source" style="display:none;">)
